        Write a function that takes an integer flight_length (in minutes) and a list of
integers movie_lengths (in minutes) and returns a boolean indicating whether there
are two numbers in movie_lengths whose sum equals flight_length.

When building your function:
Assume your users will watch exactly two movies
Don't make your users watch the same movie twice
Optimize for runtime over memory
Gotchas
We can do this in O(n)O(n) time, where nn is the length of movie_lengths.

Remember: your users shouldn't watch the same movie twice. Are you sure your method
wonâ€™t give a false positive if the list has one element that is half flight_length?
